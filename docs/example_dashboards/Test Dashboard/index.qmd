This example shows how I create the dashboard I use for testing the module. It isn't pretty but it shows a good overview of everything that is currently possible to create using the module. You'll learn how to:       
- create a new dashboard      
- add pages to the dashboard     
- add visual elements such as maps and charts to the pages  
   
# Setup    
If you don't already have python and the `{powerbpy}` module installed, please refer to the setup instructions first. 

# Build dashboards   
## Create a new dashboard
To create a new dashboard, you'll need to provide two arguments:      
1. `parent_dir` - This is the folder where you want to store your dashboard     
2. `report_name` - This is the name you want to give your dashboard project.       
     
If you want to create a dashboard called `bigfoots` in a folder called `C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects`,  here's what the code should look like    
```python    
# Import the package
import powerbpy as PBI


PBI.create_new_dashboard(report_location = "C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects", report_name = "test_dashboard")

```     
If everything worked, the function should have created the following files:

You can open the `test_dashboard.pbip` file in Power BI desktop normally. (Although you will probably need to turn on <a href="https://russell-shean.github.io/powerbpy/#dependencies">these preview features</a>. )      
    
## Add a new page
To add a new page, you'll need to provide the following arguments:

Title: "Test Dashboard"
---

# Recreate my testing dasbhoard
This example shows how I create the dashboard I use for testing the module. It isn't pretty but it shows a good overview of everything that is currently possible to create using the module. You'll learn how to:       
- create a new dashboard      
- add pages to the dashboard     
- add visual elements such as maps and charts to the pages  
   
# Setup    
If you don't already have python and the `{powerbpy}` module installed, please refer to the setup instructions first. 

# Build dashboards   
## Create a new dashboard
To Create a new dashboard, you'll need to provide two arguments:      
1. parent_dir - This is the folder where you want to store your dashboard     
2. report_name - This is the name you want to give your dashboard project.       
     
If you want to create a dashboard called `bigfoots` in a folder called `C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects`,  here's what the code should look like    
```python    
# Import the package
import powerbpy as PBI


PBI.create_new_dashboard(report_location = "C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects", report_name = "bigfoots")



# Create a new dashboard -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PBI_dash.create_new_dashboard(report_location, report_name)    
```     
If everything worked, the function should have created the following files:     
![image](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/blob/main/docs/assets/images/new_dashboard_filetree.png?raw=true)       
    
You can open the `bigfoots.pbip` file in Power BI desktop normally. (Although you will probably need to turn on <a href="https://russell-shean.github.io/powerbpy/#dependencies">these preview features</a>. )

Title: "Test Dashboard"
---

# Recreate my testing dashboard      
This example shows how I create the dashboard I use for testing the module. It isn't pretty but it shows a good overview of everything that is currently possible to create using the module. You'll learn how to:       
- create a new dashboard      
- add pages to the dashboard     
- add visual elements such as maps and charts to the pages

# Setup    
If you don't already have python and the `{powerbpy}` module installed, please refer to the setup instructions first. 

# Build dashboards   
## Create a new dashboard
To create a new dashboard, you'll need to provide two arguments:      
1. `parent_dir` - This is the folder where you want to store your dashboard     
2. `report_name` - This is the name you want to give your dashboard project.       
     
If you want to create a dashboard called `bigfoots` in a folder called `C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects`,  here's what the code should look like    
```python    
# Import the package
import powerbpy as PBI


PBI.create_new_dashboard(report_location = "C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects", report_name = "test_dashboard")

```     
If everything worked, the function should have created the following files:

You can open the `test_dashboard.pbip` file in Power BI desktop normally. (Although you will probably need to turn on <a href="https://russell-shean.github.io/powerbpy/#dependencies">these preview features</a>. )      
    
## Add a new page
To add a new page, you'll need to provide the following arguments:          
1. `dashboard_path` - This is the file path to the folder where the dashboard is stored. This can be either an absolute or relative path. (This will eventually change when I change to OOP)       
2. `page_name` - This is display name for the page you just created. (This is different from the page_id which is only used internally).      
      
You can also provide the following optional arguments:       
3. `title` - Title to put at the top of the page. This under the hood calls the `add_text_box()` function. If you would like more control over the title's appearance use that function instead.        
4. `subtitle` - This is similar to the title, but it goes below the title. If you would like more control use the `add_text_box()` function
5. `displayOption` - I'm honestly not sure what this does, someone who understands Power BI better than me will have to let me know ;). Currently the option is set to `FitToPage` and other options include `FitToWidth` and `ActualSize`.


In order to reference the page to add visuals to it later, you'll need to remember what order you created the pages in. The first page that is created when you first call `create_new_dashboard()` is called "page1", the next page you create is called "page2", the page after that is called "page3" etc. (I'm going to convert the functions to classes and methods soon at which point this paragraph will become irrelevant).        
     
In our example, I'll create a new page called "Bee Colonies" and then we'll add a title called "The bees are in trouble!" and a subtitle below it called "We're losing bee colonies". The title and subtitle arguments make a best guess about the best font and position for the text boxes that make up the title and subtitle. These arguments are optional, so if you don't want a title or subtitle, just leave the argument blank. If you want the title to have a different font, style, position, etc from the default use the `add_text_box()` function.      
   
Here's the code to create a new (mostly blank) page:     

```python


PBI.add_new_page(dashboard_path, 
	                   page_name = "Bee Colonies",
	                   title= "The bees are in trouble!",
	                   subtitle = "We're losing bee colonies"
	)

```

Here's what the new page looks like in Power BI Desktop

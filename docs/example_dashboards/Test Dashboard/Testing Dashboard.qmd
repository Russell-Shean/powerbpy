# Recreate my testing dashboard      
This example shows how I create the dashboard I use for testing the module. It isn't pretty but it shows a good overview of everything that is currently possible to create using the module. You'll learn how to:        
          
- create a new dashboard      
- add pages to the dashboard     
- add visual elements such as maps and charts to the pages

# Setup    
If you don't already have python and the `{powerbpy}` module installed, please refer to the setup instructions first. 

# Build dashboards   
## Create a new dashboard
To create a new dashboard, you'll need to provide a file path to a folder as argument:      
        
If you want to create a dashboard called `test_dashboard` in a folder called `C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects`,  here's what the code should look like    
```python    
# Import the package
from powerbpy import Dashboard

my_dashboard = Dashboard.create("C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects/test_dashboard")
```     
If everything worked, the function should have created the following files:     
![image](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/blob/main/docs/assets/images/new_dashboard_filetree.png?raw=true)       
    
You can open the `test_dashboard.pbip` file in Power BI desktop normally. (Although you will probably need to turn on <a href="https://russell-shean.github.io/powerbpy/#dependencies">these preview features</a>. )      
    
## Add a new page
Dashboards don't start with any pages until you add them. To add a new page, you'll need to provide the following arguments:          
        
  1. `page_name` - This is display name for the page. (This is different from the page_id).      
      
You can also provide the following optional arguments:       
         
  2. `title` - Title to put at the top of the page. This under the hood calls the `add_text_box()` function. If you would like more control over the title's appearance use that function instead.        
  3. `subtitle` - This is similar to the title, but it goes below the title. If you would like more control use the `add_text_box()` function       
  4. `displayOption` - I'm honestly not sure what this does, someone who understands Power BI better than me will have to let me know ;). Currently the option is set to `FitToPage` and other options include `FitToWidth` and `ActualSize`.
       
     
In our example, I'll create a new page called "Bee Colonies" and then we'll add a title called "The bees are in trouble!" and a subtitle below it called "We're losing bee colonies". The title and subtitle arguments make a best guess about the best font and position for the text boxes that make up the title and subtitle. These arguments are optional, so if you don't want a title or subtitle, just leave the argument blank. If you want the title to have a different font, style, position, etc from the default use the `add_text_box()` function.      
   
Here's the code to create a new (mostly blank) page:     

```python
page1 = my_dashboard.new_page(page_name = "Bee Colonies",
	                   title= "The bees are in trouble!",
	                   subtitle = "We're losing bee colonies")
```

Here's what the new page looks like in Power BI Desktop       
![New Page Example](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/raw/main/docs/assets/images/new_page_example.png?raw=true "Example Page")      
   
## Add background image
Here's how you can add a background image to a page. To add the image, you'll need to provide the following required arguments:      
         
  1. `img_path` - This is the path (relative or full) to the image you want to add to the dashboard       
           
    
There are two additional optional arguments:        
       
  2. `alpha` - This is the image's transparency with 0 is fully transparent and 100 is full non-transparent (defaults to 100 )    
  3. `scaling_method` - This tells Power BI how to scale the image (defaults to "Fit" which fits the image to the page)      
      
Here's some example code that adds a new background image to the Bee Colonies page:     
   
```python
page1.add_background_image(img_path = "examples/data/Taipei_skyline_at_sunset_20150607.jpg", 
	               alpha = 51,
	               scaling_method = "Fit")            
```       
    
And here's what the dashboard looks like, now that we've added a background image:      
     
![Background Image Example](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/raw/main/docs/assets/images/background_image_example.png?raw=true "Background Image Example")      

## Add a dataset
For most dashboards, you'll want to add visuals that help users visualize the data. Before you can start adding visuals, you'll need to add datasets. Here's how you can add a dataset locally stored on your computer as a csv file to your dashboard. This method is attached to the Dashboard not the Page because the same dataset can be used across multiple pages and visuals. You'll need to provide the following arguments:        
        
  1. `data_path` = The location of the csv file that you want to add. Can be a relative or full path

Here's some example code:    

```python
my_dashboard.add_local_csv(data_path = "examples/data/colony.csv")
```     
If the code worked, you should see the new dataset when you open the new dashboard. Unfortunately, you'll see a warning that looks like this about how the dashboard needs to be refreshed:     
    
To solve the problem, click `Refresh now` and then the dataset should display normally. If you save the file, it should open normally next time.  (Frustratingly, Power BI still requires that datasets to be opened in Power BI desktop to display correctly. Whatever Power BI desktop does behind the scenes is stored in a file called **/.pbi/cache.abf. The file isn't directly readable and I haven't figured out a way to recreate whatever Power BI desktop does and stores in the file).
      
## Add a chart
Here's how you can add a bar chart to your dashboard. To add the chart you'll need to provide the following required arguments:      
        
  1. `visual_id` - Give your chart a unique id that you'll remember. (Power BI's default is to generate a UUID which will be unique, but also impossible to remember. This id needs to be different from all the other visual id's in the dashboard. It will also be the name of the file inside the Power BI project folder. )      
  2. `data_source` - The name of the data source you want to use for the visual. This corresponds to the dataset_name field in the add data functions. You must have already loaded the data to the dashboard.     
  3. `chart_title` - Give your chart an informative title! This will display on the dashboard as part of the chart.    
  4. `x_axis_title` - This is the text that will label the x axis       
  5. `y_axis_title` - This is the text that will label the y axis       
  6. `x_axis_var` - This is the variable to use for the x axis        
  7. `y_axis_var` - This is the variable to use for the y axis       
  8. `y_axis_var_aggregation_type` - This is how values in the y axis should be grouped and processed. The default is sum (total value of y for each grouping of x)        
  9. `x_position` - The x coordinate of where you want to put the chart on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.      
  10. `y_position` - The y coordinate of where you want to put the chart on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.       
  11. `height` - Height of chart on the page          
  12. `width` - Width of chart on the page

Here's some example code that adds a bar chart showing bee colonies lost per year: 

```python
page1.add_chart(visual_id = "colonies_lost_by_year", 
	      chart_type = "columnChart",
	      data_source = "colony",
	      chart_title = "Number of Bee Colonies Lost per Year",
	      x_axis_title = "Year",
	      y_axis_title = "Number of Colonies",
	      x_axis_var = "year",
	      y_axis_var = "colony_lost",
	      y_axis_var_aggregation_type = "Sum",
	      x_position = 23,
	      y_position = 158,
	      height = 524,
	      width = 603)
```      
Here's what the chart that we added looks like:

# Add a text box    
In addition to visuals, many dashboards use explanatory text. Here's an example of adding a text box to a page. The following arguments are required:      
           
  1. `text` - The text you want to display in the box         
  2. `visual_id` - Give the text box a unique id that you'll remember. This id cannot be the same as any other visual in the dashboard.         
  3. `x_position` - The x coordinate of where you want to put the text box on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.      
  4. `y_position` - The y coordinate of where you want to put the text box on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.       
  5. `height` - Height of text box on the page          
  6. `width` - Width of text box on the page      

There are additional available arguments (mainly having to do with font styling) for more details, see the add_text_box() [method documentation](https://www.russellshean.com/powerbpy/reference/page._Page.html#powerbpy.page._Page.add_text_box). <strong>Don't see an argument for a text styling option you want? Feel free to submit an issue or pull request on Github to request the change! :)</strong>. Here's some example code showing how I added a text box to my testing dashboard:       
    
```python   
# This adds a text box to the bottom right corner of the first page    

page1.add_text_box(text = "Explanatory text in the bottom right corner",
                 visual_id = "page1_explain_box",
                 height = 200,
                   width= 300,
                     x_position = 1000,
                     y_position = 600,
                     font_size = 15)

```     
If the code worked, the dashboard should look something like this:    
![image](https://github.com/Russell-Shean/powerbpy/blob/main/docs/assets/images/text_box_example.png?raw=true)      
    
## Add a button     
In addition to text boxes, you can add buttons which allow the user to do things like navigate to an external website or another page in the report. (I'm far from a Power BI expert, so I don't know if it's possible to create buttons that do other things such as analyze or filter data. </strong>Feel free to submit an issue or pull request on Github to request additional button features that I haven't implemented yet!)</strong>.
The following arguments are required:     

  1. `label` - This text will display inside the button         
  2. `visual_id` - Give the button a unique id that you'll remember. This id cannot be the same as any other visual in the dashboard.         
  3. `x_position` - The x coordinate of where you want to put the button on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.      
  4. `y_position` - The y coordinate of where you want to put the button on the page. Origin is page's top left corner.       
  5. `height` - Height of button on the page          
  6. `width` - Width of button on the page      

Additional option argument are available and are described in the [function documentation](https://www.russellshean.com/powerbpy/reference/page._Page.html#powerbpy.page._Page.add_button). For this example, I'd like to highlight two of the optional arguments that enable the button to be linked to navigation:     
     
  7. `url_link` = This should be a valid url (web link). When the button is clicked the web page will open in the user's browser.
  8. `page_navigation_link` = This should be a valid page_id in your dashboard. When the button is clicked, the user will be sent to that page. Page id's are assigned sequentially in the order pages are created and follow the pattern of page1, page2, page3 etc. If you added a page manually using Power BI desktop, the page id will probably be a randow string of numbers and letters. If you aren't sure what pages are in your dashboard you can use the [Dashboard.list_pages() method](https://www.russellshean.com/powerbpy/reference/dashboard.html#powerbpy.dashboard.Dashboard.list_pages).
      
Let's add two buttons! One that sends the user to www.google.com and one that navigates the user to page 2.     

```python
# create a second page so that the page navigation button works     
page2 = my_dashboard.new_page(page_name = "Bigfoot Map",
                     title= "Bigfoot sightings",
                     subtitle = "By Washington Counties")    

# Add two buttons 
# Navigate to an internet address
page1.add_button(label = "Open Google",
  visual_id = "page2_google_button",
  height = 40,
  width = 131,
  x_position = 1000,
  y_position = 540,
  url_link = "https://www.google.com/")

# navigate back to page 2
page1.add_button(label = "Move to page 2",
  visual_id = "page1_move_to_page1_button",
  height = 40,
  width = 131,
  x_position = 1000,
  y_position = 490,
  page_navigation_link = "page2")

```     
If the code works you should get two buttons that look like this. The first button should open a new www.google.com tab in your browser. The second button should send you to page 2.

    "section": "Add a choropleth map",
    "text": "Add a choropleth map\nOften we have data that is tied to geographic regions that can be respresented by a polygon such as states, counties, zip codes, or countries. A choropleth map uses color to represent values in the data by shading the polygons according to the value of the data. (If that was way too abstract, see the example below. Basically we’re creating a color code map to represent the data.)\nThis function does a lot under the hood so you don’t have to. It creates measures in the dataset so that bins will automatically adjust when filtering conditions change, it creates the map and adds text boxes for a legend and and a slicer to allow the user to filter the data. The method requires you to provide a shape file that corresponds to a variable in your dataset. For example, the dataset could have two columns: US states and average income. In this case you should provide a shapefile of US states.\nThe method also give two different options for binning the data and assigning ranges of values to different colors on the map. You can only specify one of the two options at a time.\nThe first option is to provide a static set of breaks that you define yourself. This is ideal if you already know the structure of your data and how you want to assign ranges of values to different colors. Use the static_bin_breaks argument to pass an integer list of break values.\nThe second option is to provide a list of percentiles that you want to use to bin the data into ranges. This option is intended to be used in conjunction with a third variable that you use to filter the data. For example, assume you have a third variable in your dataset of average income by state dataset, maybe age. You could pass age to the filtering_var argument to create a slicer attached to the map that filters the dataset by age before rerendering the map. You could then pass the list of percentiles to percentile_bin_breaks such as 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. This will create breaks between 0% and 20%, 20% and 40%, etc and the bins will be recalculated each time the slicer filters are adjusted. So, for this example, if you selected “young people” in the slicer, the bins will be re-calculated and the map will re-render to show 20, 40, 60 etc, percentiles for just young people. If you provide percentile_bin_breaks you must also provide a filtering_var; the assumption being that if you don’t need dynamic recalculation of bins based on the filtering variable, you’d be better off calculating a static set of breaks for yourself and passing them as a list to static_bin_breaks.\nI’ll describe in more detail below some of the optional method arguments and how they can be used to customize your map. But first, here are the required arguments:\n\nvisual_id - Give the button a unique id that you’ll remember. This id cannot be the same as any other visual in the dashboard.\ndata_source - The name of the dataset you want to use to build the map. This corresponds to the dataset_name field in the add data functions. You must have already loaded the data to the dashboard.\nshape_file_path - A path to a shapefile that you want to use to build the map. This file can be any valid shapefile accepted by power BI. In this example dashboard I use a geojson, but presumably an Arcgis file with a .shp extension would also work. This shape file will be added to the dashboard’s registered resources.\nmap_title - The title you want to put above the map.\nlocation_var - The name of the column in data_source that you want to use for the location variable on the map. This should also correspond to the geography of your shape file.\ncolor_var - The name of the column in data_source that you want to use for the color variable on the map. This variable should be numeric.\ncolor_palatte - A list of hex codes to use to color your data. There should be one fewer than the number of bins\nadd_legend - True or False, would you like to add the default legend? (By default legend, I mean this function’s default, not the Power BI default). The legend is a set of Power BI cards the is anchored to the bottom of the frame of the map. If you would like more control over the legend, you may need to create it yourself using the add_card() method.\nheight - Height of map on the page\nwidth - Width of map on the page\nx_position - The x coordinate of where you want to put the map on the page. Origin is page’s top left corner.\ny_position - The y coordinate of where you want to put the map on the page. Origin is page’s top left corner.\n\nAdditional optional arguments are available and are described in the function documentation. As described above, the arguments unique to this method control how bins are created:\n\nfiltering_var - Optional. The name of a column in data source that you want to use to filter the color variable on the map. This must be supplied if providing percentile_bin_breaks. If you want to use percentiles without filtering (ie on static data), you should calculate the percentiles yourself and pass them to static_bin_breaks. Do not provide both static_bin_breaks and a filtering_var.\n\nstatic_bin_breaks This should be a list of numbers that you want to use to create bins in your data. There should be one more entry in the list than the number of bins you want and therefore the number of colors passed to the color_palette argument. The function will create bins between the first and second number, second and third, third and fourth, etc. A filtering_var cannot be provided if static_bin_breaks is provided. Use percentile bin breaks instead.\n\npercentile_bin_breaks - This should be a list of percentiles between 0 and 1 that you want to us to create bins in your data. If provided, a filtering_var must also be provided. This will create power BI measures that dynamically update when the data is filtered by things such as slicers. There should be one more entry in the list than the number of bins you want and therefore the number of colors passed to the color_palette argument. Here’s an example use case: to create 5 equal sized bins pass this list: [0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1]\n\nHere’s some code to add a shape map that represents bigfoot sightings by county in Washington State with the option to filter the data by the season the sighting occured.

For the method you will need to specify a data source to use, the variable to use on the starting (left) side of the chart,the variable to use on the ending (right) side of the chart, the individual values from both the starting and ending variables that you want to display on the visual and the variable that you use to count the changes over time and determine the size of arrows and bars. The Sanky chart uses a custom visual definition that is loaded automatically with the Power Bpy package. Here are the required method arguments:\n\nvisual_id - Please choose a unique id to use to identify the chart. PBI defaults to using a UUID, but it’d probably be easier if you choose your own id.\ndata_source - The name of the dataset you want to use to build the chart. This corresponds to the dataset_name field in the add data functions. You must have already loaded the data to the dashboard.\nstarting_var - Which variable from the data_source, do you want to use for the left side of the sanky chart\nstarting_var_values - Which individual values do you want to use for the left side of the sanky chart? In general, this will probably mean all the unique values in the starting_var column. This function is setup to assume that you already know the structure of your data and can pass a list of unique values.\n\nending_var - Which variable from the data_source, do you want to use for the right side of the sanky chart?\n\nending_var_values - Which individual values do you want to use for the right side of the sanky chart? In general, this will probably mean all the unique values in the starting_var column. This function is setup to assume that you already know the structure of your data and can pass a list of unique values.\n\nvalues_from_var - This is the variable that you want to count unique instances of as grouped by starting and ending variables. For now it only counts unique variables, but I’d like to add the option to provide a sum too\n\nchart_title - Give your chart an informative title!:D\n\nx_position - The x coordinate of where you want to put the chart on the page. Origin is page’s top left corner\n\ny_position - The y coordinate of where you want to put the chart on the page. Origin is page’s top left corner.\n\nheight - Height of chart on the page\n\nwidth - Width of chart on the page\n\nAdditional optional arguments are available and are described in the function documentation.The arguments unique to this method include:\n\nlink_colors - Here you can provide a list of Hex code colors for the connections between the different categories in the Sanky chart. In general this should be equal to the length of starting_var_values multiplied by the length of ending_var_values. If an argument is not provided the function assigns default colors.\n\nHere’s some example code showing how to create a sanky dashboard:\n# Add a sanky chart to page 3\npage3.add_sanky_chart(\n              visual_id = \"sales_sanky\",\n              data_source = \"sales_final_dataset\",\n              chart_title=\"Store Starting and Ending Size\",\n              starting_var=\"Starting Size\",\n              starting_var_values=[\"Large\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"],\n              ending_var=\"Ending Size\",\n              ending_var_values=[\"Large\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"],\n              values_from_var=\"Name\",\n              x_position=0,\n              y_position=0,\n              height = 800,\n              width = 615,\n)\nIf the code worked, you should see a sanky chart just to the right of the table that looks like this:\n\nNow let’s show an example of what can be done with the link_colors argument. This allows you to provide a list of hex codes for each arrow, (link if you’re using power BI’s internal vocab). Using this argument you can provide custom colors for each of the arrows, or highlight one arrow in particular with color. Here’s an example of changing the arrow colors to red, yellow, and green and also highlighting just one of the arrows by making it pink:\n# Add a new page\npage4 = my_dashboard.new_page(page_name = \"Table Page 2\")\n\n# Add a different version of the sanky chart to the new page\npage4.add_sanky_chart(\n              visual_id = \"sales_sanky\",\n              data_source = \"sales_final_dataset\",\n              chart_title=\"Store Starting and Ending Size\",\n              starting_var=\"Starting Size\",\n              starting_var_values=[\"Large\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"],\n              ending_var=\"Ending Size\",\n              ending_var_values=[\"Large\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"],\n              link_colors=[\"#CF3517\",\"#CF3517\",\"#CF3517\",\n                           \"#E3EF3A\",\"#EA1389FF\",\"#E3EF3A\",\n                           \"#26A115\",\"#26A115\",\"#26A115\"],\n              values_from_var=\"Name\",\n              x_position=0,\n              y_position=0,\n              height = 800,\n              width = 615\n              )\nIf the code worked, you should see a sanky chart that looks like this:"

That is because Dashboard.create() doesn’t just initate a new instance of the dashboard class, it also creates a set of files representing a new blank Power BI dashboard. The error is there to prevent you from accidently overwriting an existing dashboard. If you want to create an instance of the Dashboard class that represents a pre-existing dashboard, you can use Dashboard.load() to load the dashboard into python instead. Here’s an example:\nIn a separate script or python window you can run the following:\n# import the Dashboard class again\nfrom powerbpy import Dashboard\n\n# load the dashboard we just created\nmy_dashboard2 = Dashboard.load(\"C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects/test_dashboard\")   \n\n# To prove the loading worked, let's add a new page\npage5 = my_dashboard2.new_page(\"Page 5?\")\nIf the code worked, the second script/python window should have added a new page to the dashboard we created earlier"

The page’s folder name should be the same as the page_id. You could also use the list_pages() method described in the next section to find the page’s id.

The first page that is created when you first call create_new_dashboard() is called “page1”, the next page you create is called “page2”, the page after that is called “page3” etc. (I’m going to convert the functions to classes and methods soon at which point this paragraph will become irrelevant).\nIn our example, I’ll create a new page called “Bee Colonies” and then we’ll add a title called “The bees are in trouble!” and a subtitle below it called “We’re losing bee colonies”. The title and subtitle arguments make a best guess about the best font and position for the text boxes that make up the title and subtitle. These arguments are optional, so if you don’t want a title or subtitle, just leave the argument blank. If you want the title to have a different font, style, position, etc from the default use the add_text_box() function. Here’s the code to create a new (mostly blank) page:\n    my_dashboard.new_page(page_name = \"Bee Colonies\",\n               title= \"The bees are in trouble!\",\n               subtitle = \"We're losing bee colonies\")\nHere’s what the new page looks like in Power BI Desktop",

It should be in the format of https://.blob.core.windows.net/. You can find it in Azure Storage Explorer by clicking on the storage account and then looking at the blob endpoint field\nrequired\n\n\nblob_name\n\nThe name of the blob container. In Azure Storage Explorer, click on the storage account, then inside “Blob Containers” will be all your blob containers. Use the node dislay name field.\nrequired\n\n\ndata_path\n\nThe relative path to the file you want to load from the blob. It should be relative to blob_name\nrequired\n\n\ntenant_id\n\nThe tenant id of the tenant where your storage account is stored. This field is only used with browser authentication. (The default).\nNone\n\n\nuse_saved_storage_key\n\nThis optional argument tells python to look in your system’s default credential manager for an Azure Storage Account token and prompt the user to add one if it’s not there. USE WITH CAUTION, THE STORAGE ACCOUNT TOKENS ALLOW FOR A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ACCESS. CONSIDER USING SAS URLS OR INTERACTIVE BROWSER AUTHENTICATION INSTEAD.\nFalse\n\n\nsas_url\n\nA limited time single access url scoped to just the file you want to grant read access to. To generate one from Azure Storage Explorer, right click on the file you want and then choose “Get Shared Access Signature”\nNone\n\n\nstorage_account_key\n\nIt is not recommended to use this when running this function on a local computer. Hardcoding credentials into code is SUPER BAD practice. Please set use_saved_storage_key to true instead. It will store the key securely in your operating system’s credential manger. You should only pass a storage account key to the function if you are running this code in a cloud environment such as databricks and using that cloud platform’s secure secret manager.

Use the use_saved_storage_key option instead.\nThis function creates custom M code and is therefore more picky than pandas or Power BI desktop. The csv file should probably not have row numbers. (Any column without a column name will be renamed to “probably_an_index_column”) NA values must display as “NA” or “null” not as N/A. If the data is malformed in Power BI, try cleaning it first in python and then rerunning this function.\nThis function creates a new TMDL file defining the dataset in TMDL format and also in M code. The DiagramLayout and Model.tmdl files are updated to include refrences to the new dataset. Other dumb things: If you get an error when trying to open the .pbip file try changing the combatibility version to 1567 in the semanticmodel &gt; definition &gt; database.tmdl file.\nDashboards created with the Dashboard.create() function start with the compatibility version set to 1567, so you should only have this problem with manually created dashboards. I may eventually add an automatic fix for this.\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.add_local_csv(data_path)\nAdd a locally stored CSV file to a dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\ndata_path\n\nThe path where the csv file is stored.

This will allow you to create your own date heirarchies instead of using time intelligence\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTMDL is a data storage format automatically created by power BI consisting of a table and column definitions and the M code used to generate the dataset.\nIn practice this means that you can copy datasets between dashboards. You can use this function to automatically copy the TMDL files at scale\nPotential pitfalls: M needs full paths to load data. If the new dashboard doesn’t have access to the same data as the old dashboard, the data copying may fail.\n\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.create(file_path)\nCreate a new dashboard.\nmy_dashboard = Dashboard.create(dashboard_path)\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nfile_path\n\n\nrequired\n\n\nThe\n\n\nrequired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nAn instance of the dashboard class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new dashboard instance, use this function Dashboard.create(dashboard_path)\nTo load an existing dashboard use Dashboard.load(dashboard_path)\n\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.get_measures_list(\n    export_type='markdown',\n    output_file_path='',\n    starts_with='formatString:',\n)\nReturns a list of DAX measures in the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nexport_type\n\nExport type for the function result: export to a .xlsx file (parameter value ‘xlsx’), to a .csv file (parameter value ‘csv’), or output in markdown format without saving (parameter value ‘markdown’’)\n'markdown'\n\n\noutput_file_path\n\nThe path for export (if the export_type value is specified as ‘.xlsx’ or ‘.csv’).

The list of page_ids is determined from reading the “test_dashboard/test_dashboard.Report/definition/pages/pages.json” file. This assumes that page_ids listed in the page.json match the folder names.\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.load(file_path)\nLoad an existing dashboard from a file path\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nfile_path\n\n\nrequired\n\n\nThe\n\n\nrequired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo load an existing dashboard, use this function Dashboard.load(dashboard_path)\nTo create a new dashboard instance use Dashboard.create(dashboard_path)\n\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.load_page(page_id)\nLoad an existing page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\npage_id\n\nThe page_id of the page you’d like to load.\nrequired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_Page\nclass\nThis returns an instance of the Page class corresponding to the page you just loaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should use this function to load an existing page from a power BI report as an instance of the Page class. This lets you call Page methods such as those that add visuals. To list all page ids you can use Dashboard.list_pages(). You can also check the .pbip folder structure to find the page ids\n\n\n\n\ndashboard.Dashboard.new_page(\n    page_name,\n    title=None,\n    subtitle=None,\n    display_option='FitToPage',\n)\nCreate a new blank dashboard page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\npage_name\n\nThe display name for the page you just created. This is different from the page_id which is only used internally.\nrequired\n\n\ntitle\n\nTitle to put at the top of the page. This under the hood calls the add_text_box() function. If you would like more control over the title’s appearance use that function instead.\nNone\n\n\nsubtitle\n\nSubtitle to put at the top of the page. This under the hood calls the add_text_box() function. If you would like more control over the title’s appearance use that function instead.\nNone\n\n\ndisplay_option\n\nDefault way to display the page for end users (View -&gt; Page View options in Power BI).

If you used this function it will be in the format page1, page2, page3, page4, etc. If you manually create a page it will be a randomly generated UUID. To find a page’s page id, consult the report &gt; definition&gt; pages &gt; page.json file and look in the page order list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reference the page to add visuals to it later, you’ll need to remember what order you created the pages in. The first page that is created when you first call create_new_dashboard() is called “page1”, the next page you create is called “page2”, the page after that is called “page3” etc. (I’m going to convert the functions to classes and methods soon at which point this paragraph will become irrelevant).\nIn our example, I’ll create a new page called “Bee Colonies” and then we’ll add a title called “The bees are in trouble!” and a subtitle below it called “We’re losing bee colonies”. The title and subtitle arguments make a best guess about the best font and position for the text boxes that make up the title and subtitle. These arguments are optional, so if you don’t want a title or subtitle, just leave the argument blank. If you want the title to have a different font, style, position, etc from the default use the add_text_box() function. Here’s the code to create a new (mostly blank) page:\n    my_dashboard.new_page(page_name = \"Bee Colonies\",\n               title= \"The bees are in trouble!\",\n               subtitle = \"We're losing bee colonies\")\nHere’s what the new page looks like in Power BI Desktop",

Do you love love love Power BI, but wish there was a way to automatically generate parts of your dashboard to speed up your development process?\nIntroducing Power Bpy, a python package that lets you create Power BI dashboards using python. Dashboards created using these functions can be opened, edited and saved normally in Power BI desktop. Power Bpy uses the new .pbip/.pbir format which stores dashboards as directories of text files instead of binary files letting you version control your dashboards!\nStill not convinced?\nSee the use cases section below for more details about when you might use this package.\n  \n\n\nCurrently the package has functions that let you do the following without opening Power BI Desktop:\n\n\nCreate a new dashboard\n\n\nImport data from\n\n\n\ncsv file stored locally\n\n\ncsv file stored in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)\n\n\nPower BI table stored as a Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL) file\n\n\n\nAdd a page\n\n\nAdd background images to a page\n\n\nAdd visuals to a page\n\n\n\nbuttons\n\n\ncards\n\n\ncharts\n\n\nmaps\n\n\nslicers\n\n\ntables\n\n\ntext boxes\n\n\n\nGet information about your dashboard:\n\n\n\nList pages attached to a dashboard\n\n\nList measures attached to a dashboard\n\n\nLoad existing pages or dashboards into python so you can add pages, datasets, or visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you can start to build power BI dashboards using this package’s functions you’ll need the following:\n\n\n\nPython (version 3.10 or higher) and pip installed and on path\n\n\nGit installed and on path\n\n\nPower BI Desktop (You can create the dashboards without this, but not view them).\n\n\nPower BI settings:\nYou’ll need to enable some preview features in Power BI Desktop. Navigate to File &gt; Options and Settings &gt; Options &gt; Preview features and enable the following options:\n\n\n\nShape map visual\n\n\nPower BI Project (.pbip) save option\n\n\nStore Semantic Model using TMDL format\n\n\nStore reports using enhanced metadata format (PBIR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see an intro example of how to create dashboards using the package, see the test dashboard tutorial.\nFor more details about how to install python and run python scripts see the setup tutorial.\nTo see more example dashboards and the scripts used to create them see the example dashboards section of the website.\n\n\n\n\nQ: Why would I use a python package to create dashboards instead of just creating dashboards/visualizations using python tools such as flask?\nA: Many organizations only support certain tools for publishing. Power BI is often bundled with an organization’s subscription to Microsoft. If your organization lets you use flask or build webpages directly with React, then this package probably won’t be much use. If the only tool you are allowed to use to create and publish dashboards is Power BI, this package might help you build version controlled, reproducible and automated dashboard workflows using python instead of manually re-creating dashboards in Power BI desktop.\nQ: One of the reasons I like Power BI is because I don’t have to write code to build dashboards. Why would I use this instead of Power BI desktop?\nA: You don’t have to choose! Dashboards created with Power Bpy can be opened and edited normally in Power BI Desktop. Furthermore, Power BI isn’t actually a no-code tool because you have to learn DAX and M. This package give you the option of using python, (a language many people find easy to learn and use), for both data preparation and building dashboards. You also don’t have to be really good at python to use the functions in this package, see the test dashboard and example dashboards tutorials for examples of how easy it is to build dashboards with python!\n\n\n\nI welcome various types of feedback:\n\n\n\nPull requests to add features, add tests, fix bugs, or improve documentation. If the change is a major change create an issue first.\n\n\nIssues to suggest new features, report bugs, or tell me that the documentation is confusing.\n\n\nPower BI feature requests. I need help from Power BI developers who don’t neccesarily have experience with python or github. It would be really helpful if you could include a .pbix file that has the feature or even better a git diff of the dashboard before and after the change. (Use the .pbip format)\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Bpy is free and open-source, however if you found the package useful or inspiring, feel free to sponsor the project so that I can keep building it out. Additionally, I am a freelance software developer; if you would like to hire me to build out a custom Power Bpy workflow for your organization, please feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin or Bluesky."

This class is important however because its methods are public. The reason you should never create an instance of the _Page class directly is simple – it doesn’t make sense to have a page not attached to a dashboard.\nHere’s an example workflow:\nfrom powerbpy import Dashboard\n\n# Create a new dashboard\nmy_dashboard = Dashboard.create(\"C:/Users/Russ/PBI_projects/test_dashboard\")\n\n# Create a new page\npage1 = my_dashboard.new_page(\"Page 1\")\n\n# Add a visual to page 1\n\npage1.add_text_box(text = \"Explanatory text in the bottom right corner\",\n             visual_id = \"page1_explain_box\",\n             height = 200,\n               width= 300,\n                 x_position = 1000,\n                 y_position = 600,\n                 font_size = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nadd_background_image\nAdd a background image to a dashboard page\n\n\nadd_button\nAdd a button to a page\n\n\nadd_card\nAdd a card to a page\n\n\nadd_chart\nThis function adds a new chart to a page in a power BI dashboard report.\n\n\nadd_sanky_chart\nThis function adds a new chart to a page in a power BI dashboard report.\n\n\nadd_shape_map\nAdd a map to a page\n\n\nadd_slicer\nAdd a slicer to a page\n\n\nadd_table\nThis function adds a new table to a page in a power BI dashboard report.\n\n\nadd_text_box\nAdd a text box to a page\n\n\n\n\n\npage._Page.add_background_image(img_path, *, alpha=51, scaling_method='Fit')\nAdd a background image to a dashboard page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nimg_path\n\nThe path to the image you want to add.

If provided, a filtering_var must also be provided. This will create power BI measures that dynamically update when the data is filtered by things such as slicers. There should be one more entry in the list than the number of bins you want and therefore the number of colors passed to the color_palette argument.

If the data is malformed in Power BI, try cleaning it first in python and then rerunning this function. This function creates a new TMDL file defining the dataset in TMDL format and also in M code. The DiagramLayout and Model.tmdl files are updated to include refrences to the new dataset. Other dumb things: If you get an error when trying to open the .pbip file try changing the combatibility version to 1567 in the semanticmodel &gt; definition &gt; database.tmdl file. Thanks Microsoft for yet again doing a great job with backward compatibility lol. Dashboards created with the create_blank_dashboard() function start with the compatibility version set to 1567, so you should only have this problem with manually created dashboards. I may eventually add an automatic fix for this."

(The default).\nNone\n\n\nuse_saved_storage_key\nboolean\nThis optional argument tells python to look in your system’s default credential manager for an Azure Storage Account token and prompt the user to add one if it’s not there. USE WITH CAUTION, THE STORAGE ACCOUNT TOKENS ALLOW FOR A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ACCESS. CONSIDER USING SAS URLS OR INTERACTIVE BROWSER AUTHENTICATION INSTEAD.\nFalse\n\n\nSAS_url\nstr\nA limited time single access url scoped to just the file you want to grant read access to. To generate one from Azure Storage Explorer, right click on the file you want and then choose “Get Shared Access Signature”\nNone\n\n\nstorage_account_key\nstr\nPlease, Please, Please do not use this when running this function on a local computer. Hardcoding credentials into code is SUPER BAD practice. Please set use_saved_storage_key to true instead. It will store the key securely in your operating system’s credential manger. You should only pass a storage account key to the function if you are running this code in a cloud environment such as databricks and using that cloud platform’s secure secret manager. (Something like Github Secrets or Azure Key Vault)\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone DO NOT HARD CODE CREDENTIALS. Use the use_saved_storage_key option instead. This function creates custom M code and is therefore more picky than pandas or Power BI desktop. The csv file should probably not have row numbers. (Any column without a column name will be renamed to “probably_an_index_column”) NA values must display as “NA” or “null” not as N/A. If the data is malformed in Power BI, try cleaning it first in python and then rerunning this function. This function creates a new TMDL file defining the dataset in TMDL format and also in M code. The DiagramLayout and Model.tmdl files are updated to include refrences to the new dataset. Other dumb things: If you get an error when trying to open the .pbip file try changing the combatibility version to 1567 in the semanticmodel &gt; definition &gt; database.tmdl file. Thanks Microsoft for yet again doing a great job with backward compatibility lol. Dashboards created with the create_blank_dashboard() function start with the compatibility version set to 1567, so you should only have this problem with manually created dashboards. I may eventually add an automatic fix for this."

    "text": "I used the PowerBpy python module to recreate an sanky chart and table dashboard from the Workout Wednesday Group challenge. Here’s a screenshot of the original dashboard (top) and the dashboard I recreated using Power Bpy (bottom). (It appears that the data has changed since the original author created his dashboard, so my version and his look a bit different because the data is a bit different, but the overall format is pretty similiar). The rest of the blog will describe key parts of the code I used to make the dashboard. The full code is available here.\n\n\n\n\nThis example assumes that you already have python installed and setup and that you know how to install python modules such as pandas. If you don’t, please refer to basic setup instructions on this page or find one of the many great resources online that explains how to install python packages.\nOne of the central assumptions built into the PowerBpy package is that you’d prefer to write python code over using Power BI. Therefore this example will avoid writing any M or DAX and will instead use python to extract, load and transform the data. Once the data is ready will use PowerBpy to create the dashboard.\n\n\n\nThe data for this example is stored as an online zip file. The following code downloads the zip file and extracts it into a local directory.\n'''\nThis script downloads the data from Github and\nthen extracts the individual datasets from the compressed archive file.\n'''\n\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nimport requests\nimport py7zr\n\n# step 1: obtain data from github --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Define paths\nDATASET_URL = \"https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator-V2-Data/releases/download/ready-to-use-data/csv-10k.7z\"\nDATA_DESTINATION_DIR = \"data\"\n\n\n# make sure the folder exists\nos.makedirs(DATA_DESTINATION_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n\n# download the zip file from the internet\nresponse = requests.get(DATASET_URL, stream=True)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\n\n# write to file\nwith tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=\".7z\", delete=False) as tmp_file:\n    with open(tmp_file.name, \"wb\") as f:\n        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n            f.write(chunk)\n\n\n\n# extract the data\nwith py7zr.SevenZipFile(tmp_file.name, mode=\"r\") as z:\n    z.extractall(path=DATA_DESTINATION_DIR)\n\n\n\nThe original example from WoW included creating measures in Power BI using DAX and M as part of the challenge.
